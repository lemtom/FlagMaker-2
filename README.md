# FlagMaker 2

FlagMaker 2 was a complete rewrite of the original FlagMaker in Java for cross-platform compatibility. After the original project was discontinued by its original author (Andrew Arnold), I have been refactoring it to conform closer to Java conventions. Since then the project has also been mavenized.

So far, there has been a slight visual update, but functionally it is still the same as the last official release (2.0.1).

You should be able to run this with
```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```

## TO-DO
- Figure out if all includes emblems are actually in the public domain
